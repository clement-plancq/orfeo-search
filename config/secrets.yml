# Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.

# Your secret key is used for verifying the integrity of signed cookies.
# If you change this key, all old signed cookies will become invalid!

# Make sure the secret is at least 30 characters and all random,
# no regular words or you'll be exposed to dictionary attacks.
# You can use `rake secret` to generate a secure secret key.

# The secret key should be defined in an environment variable
# (SECRET_KEY_BASE). Omitting the variable causes an insecure
# key to be used.

# The fallback insecure keys are here to enable the repo to be cloned
# and deployed instantly, potentially at the expense of security.
